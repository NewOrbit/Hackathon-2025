I don’t have specific wheelchair-friendly outdoor parks in Rome to name right now that fit “low-cost, outdoors, family-friendly, not a full day.” I can still help with weather-focused planning and general outdoor options, and I can broaden the search if you’d like.\n",

      "Weather outlook for this weekend (Rome)\n",
      "- Current: about 23.4°C, feels ~23.7°C, humidity around 90%, partly cloudy.\n",
      "- Weekend forecast (based on the latest data): highs around 23–24°C with mostly cloudy to partly cloudy skies. There is some variability, so a light rain shower is possible on at least one day and conditions could shift, so it’s good to have a plan B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical, outdoorsy, low-cost ideas that are generally kid-friendly and don’t take the whole day\n",
      "- Short strolls in iconic outdoor spaces: you can enjoy the atmosphere around famous outdoor spots and fountains, which are free and quick to explore (great for kids and wheelchair users if you pick accessible routes).\n",
      "- Waterfront or riverside areas: a scenic, flat, stroller/wheelchair-friendly walk along the Tiber embankments can be relaxing for a couple of hours.\n",
      "- City squares and open spaces: large plazas and piazzas with seating areas offer easy, low-effort time outdoors without committing to a full-day excursion.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I can do next (your choice)\n",
      "- Broaden the search to include other outdoor, family-friendly options near Rome (parks, gardens, plazas, easy nature walks) and filter for accessibility and low cost. \n",
      "- Look for nearby towns or coastal spots within a short drive from Rome that are known for easy, short outdoor visits (beaches or promenades) that are wheelchair-friendly.\n",
      "- Create a 2-hour outdoor-friendly itinerary with a couple of flexible stops and built-in breaks, tailored to wheelchair access and a modest budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple of quick questions to tailor recommendations\n",
      "- Are you okay with nearby towns along the Lazio coast or would you prefer strictly within Rome?\n",
      "- Do you want to focus on parks specifically, or are plazas, gardens, and riverfronts acceptable?\n",
