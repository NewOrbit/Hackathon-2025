- Regional and categorical filtering
- Booking simulation (generates mock bookings)

## Development

The codebase follows a modular structure similar to the weather-mcp:

- **Config**: API endpoints and constants
- **Utils**: Helper functions for API calls and validation
- **Service**: Business logic and data processing
- **Main**: MCP server orchestration
