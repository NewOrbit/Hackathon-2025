## NewOrbit Hackathon — Event Overview

### Welcome
Welcome to the NewOrbit Hackathon! This repository contains all the materials you need for the day.

### Collaboration first
This is a collaboration event. Teamwork and communication are key to a fun and successful day. Share ideas openly, plan together, pair up where it helps, and keep everyone engaged.

### Teams and logistics
- Teams of 4–5, randomly assigned
- Each team has a Tech Lead (always a NewOrbit member)
- The Tech Lead forks the main repository and opens a PR back to main
- The Tech Lead grants access to all team members on their fork
- We'll use Microsoft Teams breakout rooms for collaboration

### Getting started
The project README lives in `src/README.md` and provides a high‑level overview of:
- **Required downloads and setup**
- **Environment setup** (e.g., venv) and how to run the project
- **Setting up the provided MCP servers**
- **Links to their respective READMEs** for deeper details
